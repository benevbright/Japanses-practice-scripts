1
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,198
Armin once told me
that beyond the wall

2
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:19,827
lies a great expanse of water.

3
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,468
He called it the sea.

4
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:30,304
And I always wondered...
what's beyond that?

24
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:13,178
Hey, Sasha, you even
try to steal any more food,

25
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:14,848
and we'll have
Captain Levi chop you into

26
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:16,707
bite-sized pieces. Got it?

27
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:19,589
Who, me?
I would never! Probably.

28
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,098
Hey! Did you guys
wipe the mud off your shoes

29
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:24,294
before you came in?

30
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:26,350
Huh?
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,841
Do you not see all this
stuff we're carrying?

32
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:31,754
You idiot. You really
think an excuse like that

33
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,567
is gonna play with Captain Levi?

34
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:35,369
Bad enough I had to
make your bed for you

35
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,018
this morning,
now you pull this crap?

36
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:40,049
Oh, shut it!
Who are you, my mom now?

37
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,512
We're back.

38
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:43,810
Wait, you were
chopping firewood?

39
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,483
Gotta stay in shape somehow.

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,114
You got grabbed by a Titan!

41
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,527
You should be in bed recovering!

42
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:50,196
Think you're wasting
your breath.

43
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,390
I caught her doing
sit-ups earlier, too.

44
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,778
Oh, so you're a nag and a spy!

45
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:55,830
What? How the hell...

46
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:58,495
Mikasa, you know you're
only human, right?

47
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,270
Funny. Almost feels
like we're back

48
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,604
in the Cadet Corps, doesn't it?

49
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,064
Mhmm.

50
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,885
Chaos. Makes you wonder
why they chose us

51
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:08,786
for this new Levi Squad.

52
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:12,078
Protecting Eren and Historia
is such an important mission.

53
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:14,777
Because we're all
so talented, I assume.

54
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:18,782
Sasha, what did you
just shove into your bag?

55
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:21,519
It's something that's
definitely not bread.

56
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:23,213
Really? What did I tell you?

57
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,266
C'mon, put it back.

58
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:25,803
Hey! Can we focus here?

59
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,384
We've gotta finish cleaning
before the captain gets back!

60
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:29,747
The bread, Sasha.

61
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:31,322
- Uuh...
- What's all the commotion?

62
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,510
- ..done this now?
- You know

63
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,278
we have to
conserve our rations!

64
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:36,359
You really think you can
just keep pullin' this crap!

65
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:38,015
Well I'm sick of...!

66
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:48,497
I am quite certain
I gave you enough time.

67
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:56,411
Never mind. We can discuss your
utter failure at a later date.

68
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:57,980
Eren.
Huh?

69
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,050
Hange is anxious to
get the experiment underway.

70
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:02,685
Right. Yes, sir.

71
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,681
Eren!

72
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,052
What's wrong, Eren? Get up!

73
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:16,286
The future of humanity
depends on you, damn it!

74
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,499
Get up!

75
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:22,261
Third time, and his
form's changed again.

76
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,216
He's not even ten meters tall,

77
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:26,368
and some of
his body lacks muscle.

78
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:28,698
Plus, Eren's scrawny
ass is hanging out.

79
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,291
I can see that!

80
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,037
Eren! Think you can still move?

81
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:35,392
Give us a signal
or something, will ya?

82
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:36,481
Eren!

83
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:38,054
Mikasa, wait up!

84
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:40,886
Great. The brat's at it again.

85
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:42,627
Off to the rescue.

86
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:44,499
She never learns, does she?

87
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,090
There's no response.
We're done here.

88
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,940
Eren!

89
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,300
Hot! Think you can ease up
on the steam a little?

90
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,618
Hey, be careful with him.
Can't you see he's bleeding?

91
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:00,009
You see his face, Moblit?

92
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:02,300
Sketch! Quick!
We gotta get this!

93
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:03,713
Section Commander!

94
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,237
Have you no compassion at all?

95
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,032
Ah!

96
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,363
Um. Sorry about that.

97
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:17,441
Not the outcome we'd hoped for.

98
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:19,620
We're still a long way
from being able

99
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:21,698
to use Eren's Titan
to seal the wall.

100
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,418
Yes. We've known
all along this would be

101
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,777
like grasping
at proverbial straws.

102
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:30,932
The plan's strategically sound.
And simple in theory.

103
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:33,620
All we need
is to get Eren there.

104
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:38,303
This could still work. But it's
going to depend on him.

105
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,685
Experiment's over.
All troops, withdraw at once!

106
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:44,659
Withdrawing! Go!
Make sure we weren't seen!

107
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:45,822
Right!

108
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:51,456
You ride back
to the house with Eren.

109
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,464
I'm going with Hange's group.

110
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,480
We're headed for Trost.

111
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,113
Sir.

112
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,003
<i>You must
find her with all haste.</i>

113
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,460
<i>She is the key.</i>

114
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:05,894
<i>She may know things
we understand but poorly.</i>

115
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:23,941
I see. Another failure, then.

116
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,886
Imagine if it had worked.

117
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:30,370
We could've plugged the hole in
Shiganshina in less than a day.

118
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,390
What we need is information.

119
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:34,604
It's not like there are
books on the subject.

120
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:36,573
That would make things too easy.

121
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:41,176
We do have Christa.
No. Historia Reiss.

122
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,119
Maybe she can
give us some insight

123
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:45,073
into the nature of the walls.

124
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:47,799
I did some digging
and found a report about

125
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:50,027
her life before the cadets.

126
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:52,916
The illegitimate daughter
of Lord Reiss.

127
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:55,175
Hers was not a happy childhood.

128
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:59,316
Lord Reiss is the key
to all this somehow.

129
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:03,362
Why would a mere regional lord
know the secrets of the walls?

130
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,231
Huh?

131
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:17,590
What are you doing?
You should still be in bed!

132
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:21,089
I'm all right.
I already slept a whole day.

133
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,409
Besides, it's my fault
the plan got shelved,

134
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,057
so the least I can do is help.

135
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:29,769
No! You tried, didn't you?
Don't beat yourself up.

136
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:33,035
All I care about
is getting a chance

137
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:35,167
to bring down the Beast Titan.

138
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,190
That hairy bastard
took everything from me.

139
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:40,230
I want it dead.

140
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,183
It's about time
to switch lookouts.

141
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:49,941
You ready?

142
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,374
Must be nice.

143
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:57,987
You and the others
know what you want,

144
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:00,081
even if it won't be easy to get.

145
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,726
But with Ymir gone,
I've lost my purpose.

146
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:06,604
I don't even know what
I'm fighting for anymore.

147
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:09,347
Saving her is
something to fight for.

148
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,269
Mm. Maybe.

149
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:15,480
At the time, I didn't
understand what she was doing.

150
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:17,886
I just wanted her to be safe.

151
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,417
Since then, I've been thinking.

152
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:25,003
When she left,
Ymir chose her own path.

153
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:30,245
I have no right to change that.
She doesn't need me to.

154
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:33,957
Finally. About time
you started talking again.

155
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,113
Hm?

156
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,558
When we got here,
you told us your story,

157
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,930
but then you just
kept your mouth shut.

158
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:43,066
Stopped smiling, too.

159
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:44,931
Why should I bother?

160
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,284
Huh?

161
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:50,073
Sorry, but the sweet little
Christa you thought you knew...

162
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,675
Well, that girl
isn't me anymore.

163
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:55,666
Good. I didn't really like her.

164
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,672
No one's actually as nice
as you pretended to be.

165
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,930
It was unnatural,
and, frankly, exhausting.

166
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:05,710
Oh.

167
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:08,957
Now. Well, now you're
just a normal girl.

168
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:12,441
Stupidly honest, maybe,
but still normal enough.

169
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,920
Still, you don't have to
decide about Ymir yet.

170
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:18,573
There's a part of me
that still thinks...

171
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:22,910
How did I forget that?

172
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:24,870
Hange and the others are back!

173
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,206
We're meeting in the main room.

174
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,316
Now, what's this about?

175
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:37,050
I'm sorry. Pastor Nick.

176
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:38,699
He was murdered.

177
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:43,027
Today. In the Trost barracks.

178
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,364
Hey!

179
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,699
Messing with
our crime scene, Scout?

180
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,609
Don't get any closer.

181
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:56,306
This isn't your jurisdiction.

182
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,761
A simple robbery murder.

183
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:02,284
There've been
a string of 'em lately.

184
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:05,615
I'm not buying it!
His nails were torn out...

185
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,612
Which unit are you in?

186
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:12,755
Section Commander Hange,
Fourth Squad.

187
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:14,972
And I'm XO Moblit Berner.

188
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,894
Heh. You know, when your
whole branch is garbage,

189
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:21,066
being high-ranked doesn't
make you smell any sweeter.

190
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:24,808
Listen. That man
wasn't killed by a titan.

191
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:30,534
One person killed another.
This isn't Scout business.

192
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:33,953
You're with
the First Interior Squad.

193
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,158
Funny. What're the capital's

194
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,886
MPs doing down here in Trost?

195
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:44,208
What's so strange about it?
Somebody has to get

196
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:45,955
the real work done
while you people

197
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:48,511
run around playing soldier.

198
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,983
Yes. You're completely right.

199
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,852
I see now I'm worthless
compared to you.

200
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,467
Simply being in
your presence is an honor.

201
00:10:57,544 --> 00:11:00,183
Please, allow me
to shake your hand!

202
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:03,379
All right.
You said it was a robbery?

203
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:06,846
Poor Nick. I didn't realize
he even had anything

204
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:08,730
that was worth stealing.

205
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,535
Of course, he did.
Everybody knows the Church

206
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:14,151
makes all its
little trinkets out of iron.

207
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,653
Are you saying
Nick was affiliated with

208
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,678
the Order of the Walls?

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,952
What are you playing at?

210
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:24,155
He was a friend of mine,
that's why I rushed down here.

211
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,018
Except... I thought
he was a craftsman.

212
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:28,986
Making chairs or something.

213
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,780
I even put that on his
application to board here.

214
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:32,890
Let go!

215
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,338
Still. I suppose
this is a reminder

216
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:38,831
that we never really know people
as well as we think we do.

217
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,443
Enough. Let go!

218
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,819
Of course! Sorry.

219
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:47,038
Well, then, I wish you luck
with the investigation.

220
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,351
When you catch the culprit,

221
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,499
will you tell them
something for me?

222
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:53,356
"You may feel that what
you did to him was justified,

223
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:57,367
perhaps even righteous. Well,
I don't give a single shit

224
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:59,083
what your motivation was.

225
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,619
I promise you,
I will personally see to it

226
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:04,167
that you are tortured, and the
horrors visited upon you

227
00:12:04,244 --> 00:12:06,834
will be greater than
any my friend suffered.

228
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:09,233
Yes. Far greater."

229
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,429
Please pass that along.
We'll leave you to it.

230
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,484
The pastor.
You think they killed him?

231
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:25,093
Yes, I do. That man's name
was Djel Sannes.

232
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,405
The skin on his fist
was split open.

233
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:31,069
Nick was tortured by
the Interior Military Police.

234
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,983
And then murdered.

235
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,966
I figured
the Church would want to

236
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:38,763
get their hands on Nick
when they learned

237
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,983
he was cooperating
with the Scouts.

238
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:42,538
That's why I hid his identity

239
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:44,652
and had him
stay in the barracks.

240
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:48,139
I never imagined they would
use soldiers to kill him.

241
00:12:49,183 --> 00:12:52,913
This was my fault. I should
have been more careful.

242
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:01,904
They tortured him.
Presumably for information.

243
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,927
Did they just want to know
what he'd passed on to us?

244
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:06,390
Most likely.

245
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:09,422
But these are the Interior
MPs we're dealing with.

246
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:12,335
So you can bet there's
something deeper at work here.

247
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:15,526
Now, how many nails
was the good pastor missing?

248
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:18,547
Uh?
How many? You saw, right?

249
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:20,795
I only caught a glimpse of him,

250
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:23,341
but all the nail beds
I saw were empty.

251
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:25,836
People who talk, talk after one.

252
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:29,319
If they don't, ripping off more
won't make a difference.

253
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:34,186
I'm impressed. I didn't
think highly of Pastor Nick.

254
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,792
But whatever his faults,

255
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:38,131
he stuck by his beliefs
until the end.

256
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:46,850
Which means... they have no idea
we know about the Reiss family.

257
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:50,624
But, the government
is up to something.

258
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:53,201
And we've got
a target on our backs.

259
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,855
Captain Levi, sir.

260
00:13:55,932 --> 00:13:58,217
I have a message
from Commander Erwin.

261
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,892
I went to tell him
about Pastor Nick,

262
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:04,428
but he gave me this
and sent me off.

263
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,378
Get your gear, now!
We're leaving.

264
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,629
Make it look like
we were never here.

265
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:19,820
That was close.
What if they had caught us?

266
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,755
Would they rip our nails off?

267
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:25,238
How did Commander Erwin
know they were headed here?

268
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,977
The government's passed
down some new orders.

269
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:31,632
There's been a freeze on all
Scout activity outside the wall.

270
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:34,450
We're to hand over
Eren and Historia.

271
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,742
Captain. I didn't
have time to tell you,

272
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,655
but some MPs
came for the Commander

273
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:42,313
right after I left him.

274
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,734
What? Like he's
some kind of criminal?

275
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,586
They're bringing this fight
out into the open.

276
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:52,957
No more working
from the shadows.

277
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:56,405
They're going to protect
the walls' secrets at any cost.

278
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,007
But why? And what exactly

279
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:00,585
are they after
Eren and Historia for?

280
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:04,195
They don't want them dead,
so what are they planning?

281
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:07,094
Who knows?
But they want these two,

282
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,531
and they're not
being subtle about it.

283
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:12,421
Which makes
lingering here dangerous.

284
00:15:12,498 --> 00:15:15,586
We'll move Eren
and Historia to Trost.

285
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,360
We're taking them
to the same district

286
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:19,532
where Pastor Nick
was just murdered?

287
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,109
Heading toward the interior
would be worse.

288
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:25,523
With Trost in a panic,
it should be easy to slip in.

289
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,926
And if things do go all to hell,
we can use these in the city.

290
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:31,295
That's true.

291
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:34,288
We don't know the identity
of our enemy yet.

292
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,156
I have an idea of
how we can change that.

293
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,074
Hange, I'll need you to
lend me some of your squad.

294
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,563
No problem.

295
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,273
All right, I'm going
after Commander Erwin.

296
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,923
Moblit's with me. The rest
of you will go with Levi.

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,658
Roger!

298
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:55,733
Hange!

299
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,445
Here.

300
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:01,561
I remembered a conversation
between Ymir and Bertholdt.

301
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:04,992
I wrote it down for you.
It's all there.

302
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,665
Thank you. I'll take
a look at it later.

303
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,336
Hiyah!

304
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,555
Rather quick
on the move, aren't they?

305
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:23,292
Heh. The kid may be
small, but he's disciplined.

306
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:24,672
I'll give him that.

307
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,788
An acquaintance of yours?

308
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:28,866
An old one.

309
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,930
Try not to walk
clustered together.

310
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,366
We'll stand out.

311
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:45,069
Eren and Historia,
just act normal.

312
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,839
Why's the royal flag
hanging everywhere?

313
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,046
Today must be the anniversary
of the king's coronation.

314
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:55,051
Once a year they hand out
extra rations to celebrate it.

315
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:55,974
Oh.

316
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,806
May I have
your attention, please.

317
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:02,064
King Fritz has heard
of the hardships in Trost.

318
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:04,925
He is donating the
royal family's reserves.

319
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,327
Form a line.

320
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,159
There's plenty to go around.

321
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,306
Oh, thank goodness!

322
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:11,941
Long live King Fritz!

323
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:14,543
All that food and
he's just giving it away?

324
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,179
It's not as if he needs it all.

325
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,312
Easier to control people
when they're not starving.

326
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,290
Handing out those
rations depleted more than

327
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:32,028
60% of the reserves.
That's a steep cost just to

328
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:35,452
raise morale a bit,
Lord Reiss. Quite steep.

329
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,134
It was necessary.
We had to do something

330
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:41,191
to improve the public's
opinion of the royal family.

331
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,006
Now we just need the other
pieces of the puzzle.

332
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,656
And the sooner
we have them, the better.

333
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:49,712
The Military Police
failed us again?

334
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:52,802
I'll return at once.
We'll continue the hunt.

335
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:55,918
No, we'll soon
have what we need.

336
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,142
Things are in motion now.

337
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:14,424
Behind us! Look out!

338
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:20,938
Armi...

339
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:22,967
Uh, I mean,
Christa and Eren!

340
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:25,669
Those bastards are
running off with them!

341
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:33,421
Will it really work again?

342
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:37,742
With that horse face of his,
we look nothing alike.

343
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,290
Well, Jean. Good luck.

344
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,086
Yeah. So nice.

345
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,514
Let me hear
how much you like it.

346
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:51,996
Well? How's that?

347
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,854
Feels good, doesn't it?

348
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:57,224
Come on, I'm dying
to hear that sweet voice.

349
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,574
This is why I didn't
want to go through this shit

350
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:08,445
a second time.
Screw being his body double.

351
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,692
Just give me one

352
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:13,250
little moan, lovely.
You know you want to.

353
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:19,262
How's everything going inside?

354
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,703
If we wait very much longer,

355
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,223
they'll see through
Armin's disguise.

356
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:25,802
He's... getting pawed at.

357
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,497
I see.

358
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:30,833
How's your leg? Any better?

359
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:36,411
I can move well enough.
Now, then. Did you notice?

360
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:39,880
These kidnappers are
obviously rank amateurs.

361
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,785
Why wouldn't they use
professionals

362
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:43,872
for a job like this?

363
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:46,558
You can handle
the rest on your own.

364
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:48,352
I'm going to
make my way to Eren.

365
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:49,949
Come and meet up
with me when you're done

366
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,731
taking out the trash here.

367
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,356
Yes, sir.

368
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,824
There's one more
thing you should know.

369
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,794
Just in case.

370
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,631
Tell Armin and the others, too.

371
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:15,345
You're sure about this?

372
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,847
These are the two
we're lookin' for?

373
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,427
Yeah, they fit the descriptions

374
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,231
we were given to a tee.

375
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:22,919
Huh? Where's the guard?

376
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,465
What the hell?

377
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,903
Don't even think about moving.

378
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,832
Conny! Are these four
really all of them?

379
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,648
Yeah, that's all.
No one else in the area.

380
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,816
Move again and you won't like
where the next shot hits.

381
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:01,075
All right! First,
we get these guys secured.

382
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:02,705
Then, we meet up
with the captain.

383
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:03,872
What do you mean?

384
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:07,431
Those are his orders.
He left a message, too.

385
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,434
You there! Out of the way!

386
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:19,342
Captain.
Well?

387
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:22,312
The road's crowded,
but I've seen nothing unusual.

388
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:24,460
It's not far to
Commander Pyxis' from here,

389
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:27,428
so I think we're good, but how's
the body double mission?

390
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,334
A success.

391
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,795
You don't seem
very pleased about that.

392
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,537
I'm not.

393
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:35,971
Something's wrong.

394
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:38,762
Military Police
can't be behind this.

395
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,420
They're too careful of their
reputation to use amateurs.

396
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:45,842
This is more like...

397
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:49,115
They'd know the wagon
would be followed.

398
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,125
It's support team
wouldn't be far behind.

399
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:53,565
Captain.

400
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:56,053
Wagon's almost
on the move again.

401
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,537
Nifa, you've heard of
Kenny the Ripper?

402
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:03,248
That mass-murderer
in the capital?

403
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,326
The one who slit the throats
of over a hundred MPs?

404
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:10,006
Of course, but, I always thought
he was just an urban legend.

405
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:13,342
The stories are all true.
He's no legend.

406
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:14,398
Huh?

407
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:17,357
I lived with him.
Back when I was a kid.

408
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:19,796
Yeah. Very funny, sir.

409
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:22,670
This isn't really the time
to be making jokes.

410
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:27,186
That's right. He wouldn't
care about using amateurs.

411
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,725
The team would trail the
wagon from both rear angles.

412
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,756
They'd choose a spot high up.

413
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:35,490
Somewhere with
a clear line of sight.

414
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,100
Nifa!

415
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,717
Long time, Levi.

416
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,322
Still a runt,
or have you grown some?

417
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:25,513
Woo-hoo!

418
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:29,561
Nope. Don't look like you've
changed much at all, boy.

419
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,740
Kenny!
